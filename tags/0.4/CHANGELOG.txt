Current Development Phase:
--Fixed issue where imgAltNotPlaceholder was firing on empty alt text
--Fixed bug in aMustContainText which returned result on anchors that were not links
--Fixed bug where headersUseToMarkSection was firing on any paragraph which contained the target elements

Version 0.3.8
--Fixed bug in CSS module which would force iterating over the CSS array even if it was empty

---Everything before this was from beyond the edge of time... check the SVN log!
