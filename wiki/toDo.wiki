= To-Do =

This is just a scratch-pad of all the ideas we'd like to roll into Quail before we get to a .1 release:

== Building a Virtual Browser ==

The 'Virtual browser' layer is currently just using PHP's DOMDocument model; however, we should really work on a more robust layer which parses the CSS on the page to take a look at things like display attributes and color contrast.

== Allowing overrides of how Translations are grabbed ==

Currently translations are only text files, but a developer should be able to override this with their own class that implements a single method to get a translation for a test.
